	<h4 align = "center"> As social media grows, more people want to become influencers and become connected with the world around them, but how difficult is it to become an influencer? Is it easy to maintain that influencer status once achieved? Using the data from kaggle.com, “Top Influencers Crushing on Instagram”, an influencer's score was compared to the number of followers, average likes, the total number of likes, and the number of posts each influencer had to find if there was a positive, statistically significant correlation between them. Lets see how influencing these influencers really are!</h4>

	<img src = "Followers vs Influencer score.png">
	<p> This graph compares the number of followers(in hundred of millions) to an influencer's score. There is a positive 0.36 Pearson correlation coefficient meaning that the number of followers and influencer score is proportional but they have a low correlation with each other.</p>
	<img src = "Avg Likes vs Influencer score.png">
	<p>This graph compares the average amount of likes an influencer gets(in millions) to an influencer's score. There is a slight positive 0.04 Pearson correlation coefficient meaning that the number of followers and influencer score is proportional but they have a very low correlation with each other.</p>
	<img src = "Total Likes vs Influencer score.png">
	<p>This graph compares the total number of likes(in tens of billions) to an influencer's scores. There is a positive 0.23 Pearson correlation coefficient meaning that the number of followers and influencer score is proportional but they have a low correlation with each other.</p>
	<img src = "Number of Posts vs Influencer score.png">
	<p>This graph compares the number of posts(in thousands) to an influencer's scores. There is a positive 0.17 Pearson correlation coefficient meaning that the number of followers and influencer score is proportional but they have a low correlation with each other.</p>
  	<h5 align = "center">Conclusion: Every one of these graphs has a positive correlation, but no significant correlation. It does not matter how many followers you have or how many likes you get. What matters is the content you post and your ability to educate or influence the people that consume your content. That's why the number of followers had the highest Pearson correlation coefficient because it helps if you have a lot of followers to spread the information you're putting out, but that won't necessarily increase your influencer rating. Be careful what you post out there and be mindful of the people who consume your content, because you never know who you might influence. </h5>
